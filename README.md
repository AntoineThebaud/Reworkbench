# Reworkbench

Reworkbench is a 16x16 texture/resource pack for Minecraft. It aims to enhance the base look of the game while keeping the same spirit, the same atmosphere.

Reworkbench is available for different versions of Minecraft starting from the 1.5. Full list of releases available [here](https://github.com/AntoineThebaud/Reworkbench/releases).

## Installation
Please refer to this guide : [Loading a resource pack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack).

*-> /!\ For the 1.6.1 version of Minecraft and older, move the archive to `texturepacks` folder instead.*

Some contents requires [Optifine](https://www.topminecraftmods.com/optifine-mod/) to be installed in order to work (maybe MCPatcher instead for the older versions).
