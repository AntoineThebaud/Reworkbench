## This file can NOT have any animation instructions. It probably shouldn't even have this text.
##
## The compass "animation" can have any number of frames.
## The first frame must be indicating a direction directly behind the player.
## Each frame should be slightly clockwise (compass movement, counter-clockwise player movement) from the starting position.
## The animation should go full circle until it's nearly back to its starting position.
